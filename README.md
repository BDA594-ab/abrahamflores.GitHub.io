# Introduction/Reason for Book 
The book that interested me the most is "Plotting and Visualization in Python" by Jupyter Notebook. The reason why this book caught my attention is because I had never learned how to do data visualizations using Python. Typically I would use programs such as R, Tableau, or even Excel. Once I saw that Python also had the software to make graphs, charts, heatmaps, and so on, I immediately wanted to learn more.
